description: How to handle the code in .old
globs: .old/**
---

The files in .old are from the old evalite suite and won't work with the new custom approach of the react-footgun-evals service. They will NOT be part of the app going foward

Do use the code in `.old/src/evals` as a reference going forward

Do not include any code from `.old` in imports
Do not modify, delete or add any code from `.old`
