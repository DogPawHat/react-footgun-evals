# TanStack Router Type Error Rules

## Route Path Type Errors

When encountering type errors in route paths like:
```typescript
Type '"/dashboard"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"/" | "." | ".."'
```

Follow these steps:

1. **Check routeTree.gen.ts**
   - This file is automatically generated by TanStack Router
   - Contains the source of truth for route types
   - Located at `app/routeTree.gen.ts`

2. **Regenerate Route Types**
   - Run `pnpm dev` to regenerate route types
   - This will update `routeTree.gen.ts` with latest routes
   - Alternatively, can use `pnpm build` if dev doesn't work

3. **Verify Route Structure**
   - After regeneration, check if type errors persist
   - If errors remain, there might be actual route configuration issues
   - If errors are gone, it was just stale types

## Best Practices

- Always run `pnpm dev` after adding new routes
- Don't manually edit `routeTree.gen.ts`
- Ignore type errors in route paths until after regeneration
- Keep route file names matching their intended paths
